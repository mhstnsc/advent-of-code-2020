## Conclusions

The following conclusions are in the scope of the competition which favors speed coding over other aspects. 

 * Functional approach wins in speed and correctness. So many little bugs due to explicit iterations and more code to write to create new collections
 * `C++` has poor data massaging due to the purpose of using as little memory as possible. This means more code is needed to do the data massage
 * `Kotlin` 
   * lacking the deep copy similar to C++ when it comes to mutable collections so its not easy to work with the mutable collections
   * generally fast compiler and code analysis in IDE
 * `Rust` 
   * a steep learning curve, does not look fast to develop 
   * the binary packages are cool
   * if this is alternative to C++, not sure
 * `Python` Maybe good but the lack of type safety
 * `C` - maybe someday, the lack of any data structures makes things atrocious
 * `XLS` - can be good
