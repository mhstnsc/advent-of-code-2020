## Conclusions

 * Functional approach wins in speed and correctness. So many little bugs due to explicit iterations
 * `C++`` has poor data massaging
 * `Kotlin` is lacking the deep copy of C++ when it comes to mutable collections
 * `Rust` has a steep learning curve, does not look fast to develop
 * `Python` Maybe good but the lack of types is disturbing
 * `C` - maybe someday, the lack of any data structures makes things atrocious
 * `XLS` - can be good
